A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all placebo-controlled studies of desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression. The pivotal outcome measure used to assess comparative efficacy was the mean change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score from baseline. Tolerability and safety were compared by an evaluation of reported adverse events. Standard and Bayesian methods were used to conduct the indirect comparisons.                                       Findings               Using a mixed model repeated measures analysis, the pooled weighted mean difference for the mean change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score from baseline was -2.81 (-3.72, -1.91; p < 0.001) for desvenlafaxine and -2.61 (-3.17, -2.05; p < 0.001) for venlafaxine. An indirect Bayesian analysis adjusted for baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score showed no significant difference between the two treatments (weighted mean difference -0.27; -1.17, 0.65). A standard indirect comparison of any adverse events showed no significant difference between desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine (relative risk 1.01; 0.96, 1.06; p = 0.70 and risk difference -0.01; -0.05, 0.03; p = 0.59). Standard indirect comparisons of both nausea and drop-outs identified potential differences between treatments, with the risk difference analyses suggesting a trend in favor of desvenlafaxine (nausea: relative risk 0.97; 0.77, 1.22; p = 0.80/RD -0.07; -0.12, -0.01; p = 0.02; and drop-outs due to adverse events: RR 0.86; 0.58, 1.29; p = 0.48/RD -0.04; -0.08, 0.00; p = 0.06). Based on the results of this meta-analysis, desvenlafaxine was shown to be non-inferior to venlafaxine in terms of efficacy, and has an advantage in terms of less nausea.')]\n"

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes in noncritically ill patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. In this open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and who were not critically ill (which was defined as an absence of critical care-level organ support at enrollment) to receive pragmatically defined regimens of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The primary outcome was organ support-free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. This outcome was evaluated with the use of a Bayesian statistical model for all patients and according to the baseline d-dimer level. The trial was stopped when prespecified criteria for the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were met. Among 2219 patients in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased organ support-free days as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 98.6% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% credible interval, 1.03 to 1.58). The adjusted absolute between-group difference in survival until hospital discharge without organ support favoring therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.0 percentage points (95% credible interval, 0.5 to 7.2). The final probability of the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation over usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 97.3% in the high d-dimer cohort, 92.9% in the low d-dimer cohort, and 97.3% in the unknown d-dimer cohort. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% of the patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 0.9% of those receiving thromboprophylaxis. In noncritically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis. (ATTACC, ACTIV-4a, and REMAP-CAP ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT04372589, NCT04505774, NCT04359277, and NCT02735707.).\\n\\n[22883424] This meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine at the Australian approved doses. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all placebo-controlled studies of desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression. The pivotal outcome measure used to assess comparative efficacy was the mean change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score from baseline. Tolerability and safety were compared by an evaluation of reported adverse events. Standard and Bayesian methods were used to conduct the indirect comparisons.                                       Findings               Using a mixed model repeated measures analysis, the pooled weighted mean difference for the mean change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score from baseline was -2.81 (-3.72, -1.91; p < 0.001) for desvenlafaxine and -2.61 (-3.17, -2.05; p < 0.001) for venlafaxine. An indirect Bayesian analysis adjusted for baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score showed no significant difference between the two treatments (weighted mean difference -0.27; -1.17, 0.65). A standard indirect comparison of any adverse events showed no significant difference between desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine (relative risk 1.01; 0.96, 1.06; p = 0.70 and risk difference -0.01; -0.05, 0.03; p = 0.59). Standard indirect comparisons of both nausea and drop-outs identified potential differences between treatments, with the risk difference analyses suggesting a trend in favor of desvenlafaxine (nausea: relative risk 0.97; 0.77, 1.22; p = 0.80/RD -0.07; -0.12, -0.01; p = 0.02; and drop-outs due to adverse events: RR 0.86; 0.58, 1.29; p = 0.48/RD -0.04; -0.08, 0.00; p = 0.06). Based on the results of this meta-analysis, desvenlafaxine was shown to be non-inferior to venlafaxine in terms of efficacy, and has an advantage in terms of less nausea.'"
